The objective is to provide a simulation of a CPU management system that encompasses several algorithms for deadlock avoidance and prevention, as well as scheduling algorithms like First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Round Robin, and Shortest Job First (SJF), among others. The programming language used for this task is Java. The project integrates the use of multithreading and network approaches.
